This repository is basically helpful for all college student who faces some problem in their written program , kindly refer this here i try my best to provide atmost all that program of Python which should be given to student to execute  it during LAB Periods.

## REQUEST -  PLEASE UNDERSTAND!!
Hey guys, all the program which is here is only to help students not to make them cheaters . I request you to please try it before atleast two times (try to build logic and think what the question ask) by self,if after your loyal effort,the logic not clicked then only come here and take this as a reference and after understanding it please try it again ,you will surely achieve success .

#
I had given the code file with name like p001.c,p002.c,p003.c .....so on , so you guys here take the reference which program is behind these names.


#### I had  provided output of the program  below in each program file  as comment for reference.
